# jr-cologne.de

The source code of my [personal website](https://jr-cologne.de/).

## Design

You can view the final design of my website in the [`DESIGN.md`](https://github.com/jr-cologne/jr-cologne.de/blob/master/DESIGN.md) file.

## Development

The main development phase of my website started on the 24th July 2017 and ended on the 29th August 2017. That does not mean that it is completely finished, but the focus is now more on the content of the website.
Nevertheless, I am still updating some things when needed.

## Changelog

An overview of what I have done each day during the main development phase is listed in [**CHANGELOG.md**](https://github.com/jr-cologne/jr-cologne.de/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Other changes and updates are not included in the changelog, therefore please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/jr-cologne/jr-cologne.de/releases).
